LSB SUBSTITUTION BASED IMAGE STEGANOGRAPHY USING MATLAB

Least Significant Bit substitution based Image Steganography is a type of steganography where the last bit
of each pixel is modified and replaced with secret messageâ€™s data bit.
Steganography requires a carrier object, secret data and an embedding algorithm. It also requires an
encryption algorithm and a secret key in some cases, increasing the security levels of steganography.
With this method, the least significant bits of the carrier image pixels are replaced with the secret data bits.
Payload capacity of the LSB method can be increased if more than 1 LSBs are used for message
embedding, but it makes noticeable changes in the carrier image.
